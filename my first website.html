<b>Dubai</b>
<br>
<i>I was born in New Delhi but very soon in two months I moved to Dubai. I don't remember much about it as I was very small at the time. although I remember having a lot of fun. I asked around my family and they told me a few interesting and highly recomended things in Dubai. The first and most obvious tourist attraction in Dubai is the Bhurj Khalifa. Another one is the fountain show right next to the Bhurj Khalifa, said to be the greatest along with the ones from Las Vegas. The aquarium, in Dubai Atlantis is supposed to be very good and it is right next to a restaurant called Ossianio. The remarkable thing about this restaurant is that there are double layer glass walls with live fish in between. It is really cool to look at. Dubai Festival City is also one of the most famous must-visit tourist attractions in Dubai. Select from a fantastic range of retail brands and department stores, catering to a shopper’s delight, to a variety of cuisines for all food enthusiasts. If you’re staying overnight in Festival 
City, get spoilt for choice with 4 world-class hotels that provide excellent service and comfort for short and long-term stays. Global Village is another tourist attraction in Dubai. It is located on Sheikh Mohammed Bin Zayed Road E 311 road  Dubai. It combines cultures of 90 countries across the world at one place. It claims to be the world's largest tourism, leisure, shopping and entertainment project. It is the region's first cultural, entertainment, family and shopping destination. Every year, it has over 5 million visitors over an area of 17,200,000 sq ft (1,600,000 m2). And last but not least you can't visit Dubai without going to Ferrari world and the desert safari.
